# Pig-Game
Pig Game is a fun and interactive dice game developed as part of 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero To Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann. Players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points, strategically deciding whether to continue rolling or pass the turn to avoid losing accumulated points.

Objective: The goal of the Pig Game is to be the first player to reach a certain score threshold, typically 100 points.

Players: The game is played by two players taking turns.

Gameplay:
On a player's turn, they roll a six-sided die.
If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn, and their turn ends. Control passes to the next player.
If the player rolls a number other than 1, that number is added to their turn total, and they can choose to either roll again (risking their current turn total) or hold (keeping their current turn total and adding it to their overall score).
If a player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their overall score, and their turn ends. Control passes to the next player.

Winning: The first player to reach or exceed the pre-defined score threshold of 100 points wins the game.
